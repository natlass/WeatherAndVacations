## What's the weather like as we approach the equator?

This assignment was broken into two parts: WeatherPy and VacationPy.  WeatherPy took a brief look into the relationships between latitude and cloudiness, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.  Using the information from that analysis, and GoogleMaps API, I took a further look into hotels in locations with perfect temperature, humidity, and weather.  Perfect for the next vacation planning.
